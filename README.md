# conway

Team 4's stab at Conway's Game of Life, with additional bits added later.

## Usage

The Clojurescript does everything but advance the state of the game, but there is a Scheme program which will run a game for any size grid.

## License

Distributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.
